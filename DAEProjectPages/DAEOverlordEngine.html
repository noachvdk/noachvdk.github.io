									<h1>Minigin engine</h1>
								</header>
								<p>First off if you would like to take a look at the source code for this project of mine you can take a look at it on my GitHub account which is linked.
								<br/>Okay so for this project we started from a start project which was capable of rendering some text and pictures. That was the starting point to (re)make this project into a fully functional engine that is capable of running qbert which we also had to make using the engine.
								<br/>I started off with implementing a decent Update loop. I decided that a fixed update loop wasn't necessary for the scope of this project since physics won't be added. In this step i also added a time manager singleton class that would keep track of the deltatime variable.
								This way I didn't need to pass the deltatime variable along which could get messy at the cost of a little less clear dependency.
								<pre><code>while(m_Continue)
{
	const auto currentTime = high_resolution_clock::now();
	const float deltaTime = duration&ltfloat>(currentTime - lastTime).count();
	time.Update(deltaTime);
		
	m_Continue = input.ProcessInput();

	sceneManager.Update();
	collisionManager.Update();
	renderer.Render();
			
	lastTime = currentTime;
}</code></pre>
								My second main concern was implementing a Component system that works with Gameobjects. This way i would replicate the system Unity and Unreal use were i could make a Gameobject to which i could attach different components
								untill the specified gameobject does what i want it to. An example of a game object with a fps counter <code>auto go = std::make_shared&ltGameObject>(); go->AddComponent(new FpsComponent{ "lingua.otf",24 });</code>
								<br/> After this i went on to implement an Input manager that works with both keyboard and controller input. Then I added in the command pattern. This way you can easily remap which keys correspond to which action. I also added a Logger to easily Log errors, warnings or info.
								<pre><code>AddInputAction(InputAction{ 0, SDLK_a, TriggerType::OnPress, ControllerButton::ButtonY, std::make_shared&ltMoveUpLeft>() });
Logger::GetInstance().Log(LogType::Info, "logging info");</code></pre>
								Afterwards i started to implement sounds. to overcome having code calling and excecuting sounds in parts of codes where it doesn't belong i used the servicelocator pattern. The soundsystem uses an eventque and runs on a seperate thread. 
								<br/>I also added in the observer and subject pattern. The level data is read in from a simple text file. This function will also run on a seperate thread. Threading times in the levelparser with shape:
								<br/>With threading 5.734ms, Without threading 8.094ms.<br/> The UI is done by with the help of ImGUI.</p>
