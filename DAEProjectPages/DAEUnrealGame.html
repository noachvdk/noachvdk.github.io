									<h1>Unreal game</h1>
								</header>
								<p> This project is the first real game i made in Unreal Engine 4. It's a mix between a third person shooter and a dungeon crawler with some rogue like elements mixed in.
								The main gameplay loop consist of completing each level(finding keys and clearing rooms to progress) while keeping a lookout for vendors and shrines. <br/>Vendors are divided into 2 types ones that sell consumables like ammo and healthpacks and ones that sell guns.
								The guns and ammo are also subdived into 3 types. <br/>The basic pistol you start with which has unlimited ammo but not that much damage and slow fire rate. Then you also have the red weapons which has guns like the assault rifle and submachine gun.
								And lastly the blue weapons that consist of snipers and semi-snipers. You can have 1 weapon of each type but ammo is specific to eqch type.<br/>
								The enemies are divided into 2 main types Ranged and close combat. Each main type has several subdivisions like smaller faster enemies with less health or a ranged enemies that teleports between a few positions.
								<br/>The rogue like elements come into play with each run you start over from scratch but each level you can gain gold to buy ammo/guns/shields or to regain some health since there is no health regen.</p>
